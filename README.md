# Wendy's Calorie Counter
I am a food reviewer. Here on GitHub, I plan to make a calorie counter tool for Wendy's menu items.
The details for the prices and calories information for this project were collected from [![Wendy's Menu]([https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eAC7B1GoMATs_ZgL4eBv39ND_pV7QSNG/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eAC7B1GoMATs_ZgL4eBv39ND_pV7QSNG/view))]([Link URL](https://wendy-menu-prices.com/))
